This program was written using Python 3.10.4 on Windows. 

It uses Tkinter to provide a GUI to the backup process. The output of the backup, is a ".btx" file that is fully compatible with the original uBITX Memory Manager developed by KD8CEC.

I can be reached with thru my email on QRZ or thru topics on the groups.io BITX20 group. You should also be able to raise Issues on the GitHub. Let me know if you have an issue here.
