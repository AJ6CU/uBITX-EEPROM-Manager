# uBITXgeneratebackup

This program was written using Python 3.10.4 on Windows. It requires the pySerial library to be included. Let me know if you find any other unusual dependencies.

The user configurable settings are in "backup_userconfig.py". You should only need to modify two variables to run this:

COM_PORT = "COM24"
BACKUPFILE= "binarybackupdump.btx"

You should replace COM14 with the COM port that your uBITX comes up at when connected to your computer via USB. A possible MacOS com port is also provided but is commented out with a prefix of "#".  

Your choice on the backupfile name. Just remember to maintain compatibility with the original uBITX Memory Manager, you need to keep the ".btx" extension. Also don't go messing with the file in a binary editor. Yes, I know that the second 1024 bytes (of the 2048 byte length file) are just zeros. But the uBITX Memory Manager likes it that way and I wanted to maintain compatibility.

I can be reached with thru my email on QRZ or thru topics on the groups.io BITX20 group. You should also be able to raise Issues on the GitHub. Let me know if you have an issue here.
