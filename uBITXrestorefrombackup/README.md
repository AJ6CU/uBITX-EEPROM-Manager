# uBITXrestorefrombackup

This program was written using Python 3.10.4 on Windows. It requires the pySerial library. Let me know if you find any other unusual dependencies.

You should only need to modify two variables to run this:

COM_PORT = "COM14"
BACKUPFILE= "binarybackupdump.btx"

You should replace COM14 with the COM port that your uBITX comes up at when connected to your computer via USB. Your choice on the backupfile name (as long as it exists). Just remember to maintain compatibility with the original uBITX Memory Manager, you need to keep the ".btx" extension. 

I can be reached with thru my email on QRZ or thru topics on the groups.io BITX20 group. You should also be able to raise Issues on the GitHub. Let me know if you have an issue here.
