			The heard of the uBITX transceiver is a microcontroller (MCU). The uBITX is manufactured by HF Signals (https://www.hfsignals.com/) using an Arduino Nano V3 MCU. The MCU includes flash memory of approximately 32kb as well as an 1024 bytes of Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM). The flash memory holds the firmware or program where as the EEPROM is used to store settings (e.g. calibration information, last used frequencies and modes, tuning rates, etc.).

			Although functional, the original firmware provided by HF Signals only supported a 2 line LCD As a result, Dr. Ian Lee (KD8CEC) developed an enhanced version of the firmware that provided a graphical user interface that used the screens from Nextion. www.hamskey.com documents in a blog format Dr. Lee's efforts as he developed this software.

            This backup only works with KD8CEC derived firmware. The original KD8CEC is available at: https://github.com/phdlee/ubitx That version only supports Arduino Nano based version of the uBITX. For uBITX's which have had their Raduinos replaced with designs derived from AJ6CU (which includes faster processors and an external larger EEPROM), that source code (as well as the source code to this application) resides at: https://github.com/aj6cu .

			Restoring your uBITX

            1. Turn on your uBITX. Wait for it to fully start and display a frequency on the VFO.

            5.	When you originally installed KD8CEC, it saved the original calibration information in bytes 64-100 in the EEPROM. In general, you do not want your
			restoration to mess with these bytes. The exception would be if this is a brand new processor and/or EEPROM and the Factory Settings are empty. In that
			case you would want to check the "Overwrite Factory Recovery Data".

            6.	Click the "RESTORE" button to start the restoration process. The processing of restoring is recorded in the "Restore Log" in the center of the page.

            7.	If an error occurs, for example you selected the wrong COM Port, correct it and click RESTORE again. You can save the record of the restoration process (which includes the location of the backup file) by clicking the "Copy Log To Clipboard" and then pasting it into an email or word processing program of your choice. Once you receive the "Restore Successfuly Completed" message, click the Quit key to exit.

            This program can use a backup (".btx") file generated by the original uBITX Memory Manager that was written by KD8CEC.
